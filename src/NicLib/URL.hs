-- | Non-strict parsing of well-formed http(s) URLs. Undefined behavior for malformed URLs; a malformed URL may produce either Nothing or a URL object with unsensible record values. A non-http(s) URL will parse into scheme and the remainder of the URL will be stored in path.
-- str2url does not follow relative URL parsing as described in ยง5.2.2 of the RFC. Instead, simply, the relative URL we're parsing will inherit any missing fields (execpting query and fragment) from the referrer, if a referrer is given, and if those missing fields are non-empty in the referrer. A relative URI without a referrer will always produce Nothing.
-- The merging of paths and removal of dot segments (ยง5.2.3 and ยง5.2.4 respectively) are implemented with functions equivalent to the algorithms given in the RFC. (Or at least they're supposed to be; see below.)
-- str2url mempty _ = Nothing
-- The second parameter is an absolute URL used to absolutify the URL we're trying to parse, if that URL is relative (i.e. its domain is null). Trying to parse a relative URL without a referer will produce Nothing. If parsing an absolute URL, the referer has no effect.
-- Ambiguity resolution:
-- * "google.com" vs. "index.html": parsed as path if a referrer is given; otherwise domain
-- * "user:pass@domain.com" vs. "mailto:user@domain.com": assumes latter (scheme, user, and domain, except that, because this is not http(s), it'll actually be scheme and path)
-- "nic@com.com" produces a URL whose only non-null field is domain, with "nic@com.com" as its value. In the first versions of this parser, I would assume nic as username, and com.com as domain. However, after considering the mailto scheme, I realized that such a URL is really ambiguous, depending on which scheme I assume! Thus I return a garbage URL. Perhaps I should return Nothing or Left "ambiguous".... There are many URLs of such a form (where it looks like a sensible URL, but when you examine it in enough detail that you're able to parse it, you find that you actually cannot parse it,) and I'm quite uncertain about my ability to debug them.
-- str2url was written for a web scraper. Although I took some effort to make it work for URLs in general, testing that it works for all kinds of URLs is tricky. I can say that works for all properly-formed sensible http(s) URLs, and all URLs whose schemes do not have double slashes. In hindsight, I see that it handles a great many nonsense cases: when parsing login credentials, port, and domain, http URLs where the http scheme does not have double-slashes - which, obviously, does not exist!
